The most recent substantial iteration of this course was developed by Fergus Cooper, Beth Dingley, and Elliot Howard-Spink.


## Why Maths?

Maths is the language we use to quantitatively describe the world.

You are going into research, and you

- **may** need to be proficient in maths as a tool for describing what you work on
- **will** have to read and understand papers that use maths

Some of you **may** feel you don't need to know any maths, but this course will be useful to you even if you never have to write down a system of differential equations yourself.

**Data analysis:**

- Interpretation and inference
- Identify patterns, trends, relationships
- Deal robustly with uncertainty and variation

**Describe the behaviour of systems:**

- Remove ambiguity: explicit assumptions
- Quantitative hypotheses
- Make predictions, through simulation and analysis
- "If I make this intervention, I expect to see that change"
- Explain **why** something is observed


**Vital for dynamic and nonlinear systems**

- Simple intuition breaks down
- Most of biology is dynamic and nonlinear!


## Course aims

- Develop confidence in your mathematical abilities
    - Extensive practice
- Become able to communicate effectively with mathematical collaborators
- Ensure you can read and understand mathematical papers in your field
- Build on your ability to apply computational tools from **Python** to solve problems

## Topics covered

- Graphs, and basic tools such as logs
- Calculus: differentiation & integration
- Complex numbers
- Ordinary differential equations
- Linear algebra (matrices)
- Coupled systems of ordinary differential equations
- Use of Python
