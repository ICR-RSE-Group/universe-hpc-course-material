## Basics

Terminology:

- $Y$ or $y$ is the *dependent* variable, sometimes called the *ordinate*
  marked on the vertical axis
- $X$ or $x$ is the *independent* variable, sometimes called the *abscissa*
  marked on the horizontal axis
- The dependent variable is said to be graphed *against* the independent
  variable

Essential Features:

- Title
- Axis labels (and units if appropriate)

## Equation of a straight line

Defined by a gradient, $m$, and a $y$-axis intercept, $c$:

$$y = m x + c$$

Interpretation:

- The intercept of this line on the $y$ axis is given by $y=c$, since at $x=0$,
  $y = c$


- The gradient of this line (also called its "slope") is given by
  $$m = {y_2-y_1\over x_2 - x_1}$$
  ("change in $y$ divided by change in $x$")


- The intercept of this line on the $x$ axis is given by $x = -{c \over m}$,
  since at $y=0$ we must have $mx=-c$
